                <h3>üëâ Guidelines for recording Audioüìù</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Choose a Quiet Environment:</strong><br>
                    Find a quiet space with minimal background noise. Avoid areas with traffic, appliances, or other sources of noise.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>2. Minimize Echo:</strong><br>
                    Opt for rooms with soft furnishings like curtains, carpets, and furniture to reduce sound reflection and echo.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>3. Avoid Filler Words:</strong><br>
                    Be conscious of using filler words like "um," "uh," "like," and "you know." Speak clearly and confidently.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>4. Speak Slowly and Clearly:</strong><br>
                    Enunciate words clearly and avoid speaking too quickly. This helps in accurate transcription.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>5. Position Microphone Correctly:</strong><br>
                    Position the microphone close to your mouth to captures your voice optimally while minimizing background noise.<br>
                    <br>

                    <strong>6. Prevent Humming or Buzzing:</strong><br>
                    Ensure that electronic devices are properly grounded to avoid any humming or buzzing interference.<br>
